# The Diet Cost Subsistence Problem

The Restaurant Meals Program by CalFresh, California's Food Stamp Program, allows individuals who are homeless, elderly (age 60 and over), and disabled CalFresh households to use CalFresh benefits to purchase prepared meals to participating restaurants.

This dataset provides the macronutrient food information on different types of food available (as of March 1, 2021) from the following locations: 
 1. Carl’s Jr. 871 Marina Village Pkwy. Alameda, CA 94501 
 2. Carl’s Jr. 3770 Telegraph Ave. Oakland, CA 94690 
 3. Pizza Hut 2617 Decoto Rd. Union City, CA 94587 
 4. El Torero Taqueria 5801 International Blvd. Oakland CA 94621
 5. Jamba Juice 3962 Mowry Ave. Fremont CA 94538

The data was constructed by creating a list of the available food items from each location. If available, we used the nutrition information provided by the restaurant. For well-known franchises, Carl's Jr, Pizza Hut and Jamba Juice, nutritional information was found through their website. For El Torero Taqueria, some food items lacked available nutrition information and had to be estimated through third-party websites such as SparkPeople.
